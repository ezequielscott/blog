# Hi! :)

My name is Ezequiel Scott, and I am currently working as a Research Fellow at [University of Tartu](https://www.ut.ee/en), Estonia. My research interests are mainly related to agile software development and software analytics. I have also been working on research that lies at the intersection between software engineering and education, mainly focusing on adaptive environments for aiding students in their learning process. I have a strong interest in human factors and psychological issues involved in software development. 

I graduated from [UNICEN](https://www.unicen.edu.ar/) in Systems Engineering in Tandil, Argentina, 2012. In the same year, I obtained a scholarship from the [National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET)](http://www.conicet.gov.ar/?lan=en) to complete my doctoral studies. In 2016, I obtained the degree of Doctor in Computer Science at UNICEN. 
In 2017, I moved to Estonia for new challenges. Since May 2017, I have been part of the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en) at University of Tartu. My research has been published in international conferences and journals including the *Journal of Systems and Software*, *Computers in Human Behavior* and *IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies*.
